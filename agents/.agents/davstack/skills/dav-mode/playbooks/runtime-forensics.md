# Runtime forensics

Read [Playbook runtime](../references/playbook-runtime.md) before executing these steps.

Select each delegate's reasoning level and speed per [dav-mode's Subagents rules](../SKILL.md#subagents), using only controls the current harness actually supports.

**You own the diagnosis. Instrument the live process, don't theorize from source.** The deliverable is a cited diagnosis, not a fix.

1. Capture the live signal on the matching surface through the project's matching verification/control workflow: a CPU profile for a spinning process, a heap snapshot for a leak, a CDP trace for a visual glitch. A real artifact, not a guess.
2. Reduce the artifact to the smoking gun: the function on the hot path, the retainer chain from the leaked object to a GC root, the loop firing without input. Parse large artifacts in a subagent (the [guard-the-context-window principle](../../principle-guard-the-context-window/SKILL.md)), keep the reduced finding in the main thread.
3. Prove the mechanism before believing it. Inject instrumentation through the runtime's supported debugging API (for example, CDP eval for a browser), or apply an authorized live-code hotfix without reloading, to confirm the hypothesis cheaply.
4. Map the finding back to source: file, symbol, the line that allocates or schedules.
5. Throughput checkpoint stays one line: `throughput checkpoint: n/a, read-only forensics`.

**Reply:** the signal captured, the reduced finding, how you proved the mechanism, the source location, artifact paths. No fix unless asked. Hand back to Bug fix or Perf once the cause is known.
